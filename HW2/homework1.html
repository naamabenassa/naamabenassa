    As an afterthought, I will summarize some of the implications of what I have written about
    intersubjectivity, especially in relation to the discussion developed over the last decade.
    I use the term intersubjectivity not to refer to the generalization in which we act in the presence
    of two people - in a purely interpersonal field, but rather to the particular matter of recognizing 
    one another as an equal center of being. My use is derived from a philosophical process carried out by 
    Habermas out of the superiority of a subject who knows or transforms the object into a subject that 
    communicates with other subjects. <br><br><br><br><br>
    </p>
    <p id="p3">This line of thinking, which returns to Hagal, is somewhat different from that of Stolorow and
    Atwood (1992; Atwood and Stolorow, 1984), their definition of intersubjectivity refers to the interplay 
    between different subjective worlds. This definition does not tell us how the intersubjective differs from
    the interpersonal, a term that used to denote the matrix of relationships that make up the life of the soul.
    Nor does it sufficiently differentiate between subjects and objects, such as the supreme issue of how a
    child comes to know his mother as a separate subject and does not refer to her as an object. In my opinion,
    only by speculating on such recognition can we give interestivity a clear and specific meaning. <br><br><br><br><br>
    </p>
                
    <p id="p4">I use the term intersubjectivity, as Stern (1985), to describe the
    The developmental achievement of cognition (see Aaron, 1996). I think of intersubjectivity as a complement to
    the aspects of mental life, expanded by the intrapsychic theory of object relations, and objectivity adds to the o
    object relations perspective the idea that our representations and relationships can be drawn on the axis of 
    the tension between recognizing and negating the other. (1994), both perspectives can include awareness of interpersonal
    relations, but the intersubjective dimension refers to a particular axis of these relations. <br><br><br><br><br>
    </p>
                
    <p id="p5">Lacan (1988), whose idea of intersubjectivity also arose from the Hegelian idea of the struggle for recognition,
    The distinction between relations or And his perception of the imaginary and the symbolic was in some ways roughly parallel 
    to Winnicott's (1971) distinction between object reference and use.As I see it, our mental life is always somewhere 
    in this tension between relating to the object and recognizing the other outside, Between contact with external reality 
    and omnipotence, each relationship is always definable in terms of negative movement and recognition, each other seems
    to us more or less as an object or a subject, or rather as a combination of them. <br><br><br><br><br>
    </p>
                
    <p id="p6">The problem with the approach that compares the intersubjective field with the interpersonal field of object
    relations is that it may attribute a mental failure or conflict to an impact on developing abilities (deep structure) by 
    an interpersonal environment (eg Gentile, 1998) To say that in a good enough environment, mental conflict will be minimal. 
    My opinion is that the opposite is no less true: failure on the level of interpersonal relations must be explained by 
    the problematic and conflictual structure of the nature of the soul
